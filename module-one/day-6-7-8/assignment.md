# Days 6-8 Assignment: Cloud Deployment and Modern Front-End Development

## Objective
Deploy a simple application to a cloud platform and create a modern front-end interface for it.

## Tasks
### Day 6: Cloud Basics and Deployment
1. Sign up for a free tier account on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
2. Create a simple "Hello World" application (if you haven't already)
3. Deploy your application to your chosen cloud platform
4. Set up basic monitoring and logging for your application

### Day 7: Agile and DevOps Practices
1. Create a Kanban board (e.g., using Trello or GitHub Projects) for your project
2. Write user stories for a to-do list feature
3. Implement automated testing for your application
4. Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for your cloud-deployed application

### Day 8: Modern Front-End Development
1. Choose a modern front-end framework (React, Vue, or Angular)
2. Create a simple to-do list application using your chosen framework
3. Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
4. Deploy your front-end application to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)

## Submission
- URL of your cloud-deployed backend application
- URL of your deployed front-end application
- Screenshot of your Kanban board
- Link to your project repository with CI/CD configuration

## Evaluation Criteria
- Successful deployment to a cloud platform
- Implementation of basic monitoring and logging
- Proper use of Agile practices (user stories, Kanban board)
- Functionality of the front-end application
- Correct implementation of CI/CD pipeline
