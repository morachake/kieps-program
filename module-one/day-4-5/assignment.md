# Days 4-5 Assignment: Setting Up CI/CD for a Simple Web Application

## Objective
Create a simple web application, containerize it, and set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Tasks
### Day 4: Application and Docker
1. Create a simple "Hello World" web application using a framework of your choice (e.g., Flask for Python, Express for Node.js)
2. Write a Dockerfile to containerize your application
3. Build and run your Docker container locally
4. Push your container image to Docker Hub

### Day 5: CI/CD with GitHub Actions
1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
   - Builds your Docker image
   - Runs tests (you can add a simple test that checks if the app returns "Hello World")
   - Pushes the image to Docker Hub (on successful tests)
2. Set up a free-tier cloud service (e.g., Heroku) to deploy your container
3. Add a step in your GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to your chosen cloud service

## Submission
- URL of your GitHub repository
- URL of your deployed application
- Screenshot of your GitHub Actions workflow runs

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality of the web application
- Correct Dockerfile configuration
- Successful GitHub Actions workflow
- Proper configuration of deployment to a cloud service
