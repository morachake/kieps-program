# Days 9-10 Assignment: Building a Full-Stack Application with Django Backend

## Objective
Create a full-stack application with a RESTful API backend using Django and a frontend that interacts with this API.

## Tasks
### Day 9: Django Backend Development
1. Set up a new Django project and app
2. Create a model for a simple resource (e.g., "Task" for a to-do list)
3. Set up Django REST Framework
4. Create a RESTful API for your resource with CRUD operations
5. Implement serializers and views for your API
6. Add basic error handling and input validation

### Day 10: Frontend Integration and Deployment
1. Update your frontend application to interact with your new Django API
2. Implement API calls for all CRUD operations
3. Add error handling and loading states in the frontend
4. Deploy your Django backend to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku)
5. Update your frontend deployment to use the new backend URL
6. Implement basic authentication for your application (if time permits)

## Submission
- URL of your deployed full-stack application
- Link to your project repository (containing both frontend and backend code)
- Brief documentation of your API endpoints

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of RESTful API principles using Django REST Framework
- Proper use of Django models and ORM
- Functionality of the full-stack application
- Code quality and organization
- Successful deployment of both frontend and Django backend
- Proper error handling and user experience considerations
