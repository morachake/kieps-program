## 🛠️ Setup Instructions  

### Prerequisites  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (or relevant runtime if using another language)  
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/morachake/kieps-program.git
cd kieps-program
🧑💻 Development Workflow
1. Create a Branch
Always create a new branch for your work:

bash
Copy
git checkout main              # Start from the main branch
git pull origin main           # Get latest changes
git checkout -b your-name/feature-description  # Create new branch
# Example: git checkout -b student1/add-user-login
2. Make Changes
Edit files in your code editor

Test your changes locally

3. Commit Changes
bash
Copy
git add .                      # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
4. Push to Remote
bash
Copy
git push -u origin your-branch-name
🚦 Code Review Process
1. Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the repository on GitHub

Click "Compare & pull request"

Add details:

Title: Feature description (e.g., "Add user authentication")

Description: Explain your changes

Assign reviewers (fellow students/instructor)

2. Address Feedback
Make additional commits if requested

Push updates to the same branch

3. Merge Approved PR
Maintainers will merge after approval

Delete merged branches

🔄 Post-Merge Cleanup
bash
Copy
git checkout main             # Return to the main branch
git pull origin main          # Sync with latest changes
git branch -d your-branch-name # Delete local branch
